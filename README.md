Reduce and simplify all features of all or any [vector tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) in an [MBTiles](https://www.mapbox.com/help/an-open-platform/#mbtiles) container.

Helpful in case

* your maximal projection size is much smaller than the tiles' one

* you want to create a ultra-low-bandwidth MBTiles version

## Requirements

* The upstream library [`tilegrinder`](https://github.com/rastapasta/tilegrinder) uses the native protobuf wrapper library [`node-protobuf`](https://github.com/fuwaneko/node-protobuf) for its magic

* To let it build during `npm install`, take care of following things:

  * Linux: `libprotobuf` must be present (`apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libprotobuf-dev`)

  * OSX: Use [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh/) to install `protobuf` with `brew install pkg-config protobuf`

  * Windows: `node-protobuf` includes a pre-compiled version for 64bit systems


## How to install it?

    npm install -g tileshrink
